Document: Implementing Oracle to GemFire Cache Data Pipeline using Spring Cloud Data Flow (SCDF)


---

1. Introduction

Overview of the requirement to dump Oracle database view records to GemFire Cache.

Introduction to Spring Cloud Data Flow (SCDF) as a data pipeline management tool.

Key benefits of using SCDF for scalable, reliable, and efficient data processing.

Emphasis on low latency, high performance, and faster data processing using this approach.

2. Solution Architecture

Components Involved:

Oracle Database: Source database with views.

Debezium: Captures Change Data Capture (CDC) events.

Kafka: Acts as the messaging layer to transport events.

Spring Cloud Data Flow (SCDF): Orchestrates data pipelines using application JARs.

Spring Boot Application: Contains logic for data mapping, view creation, and GemFire data updates.

GemFire Cache: Stores the processed data for downstream use.


Data Flow:

1. Debezium captures changes from Oracle tables.


2. Kafka receives the CDC events.


3. SCDF runs Spring Boot JARs that consume Kafka messages.


4. Data Mapping and business logic are applied to create views.


5. Processed data is saved to GemFire Cache.

3. Why Choose SCDF?

This approach provides several advantages over directly running applications:

✅ Low Latency and Speed

Parallel Processing: Multiple application instances can be deployed to handle large datasets, reducing latency.

Streaming Efficiency: Kafka ensures real-time data ingestion, minimizing data transfer delays.

In-Memory Data Management: GemFire’s low-latency, in-memory storage enhances read/write operations.


✅ High Performance

Auto-Scaling: SCDF automatically scales applications based on data load, ensuring consistent performance.

Optimized Resource Utilization: Resources are used only when necessary, preventing unnecessary overhead.

Fault Tolerance: Built-in retry mechanisms handle failures, preventing data loss.


✅ Operational Simplicity

Central Management: Manage and monitor the entire data pipeline using the SCDF Dashboard.

Faster Deployments: Application JARs can be easily deployed, updated, or rolled back.

End-to-End Monitoring: Provides insights into message flow, error rates, and performance metrics.

4. Step-by-Step Implementation

4.1. Install and Configure SCDF

Download and install spring-cloud-dataflow-server and spring-cloud-skipper-server.

Configure databases for SCDF metadata storage.

Start SCDF using the command:

java -jar spring-cloud-dataflow-server.jar
java -jar spring-cloud-skipper-server.jar


4.2. Configure Kafka and Debezium

Set up Kafka without Zookeeper using KRaft mode.

Install and configure Debezium Oracle connector.

Ensure CDC events are published to Kafka topics.


4.3. Develop Spring Boot Application

Implement a Kafka consumer using @KafkaListener.

Perform necessary data transformations.

Use the GemFire client to store the data:

@Autowired
private GemfireTemplate gemfireTemplate;

public void saveToCache(ViewObject viewObject) {
    gemfireTemplate.put(viewObject.getKey(), viewObject);
}


4.4. Build and Package Application

Package as a JAR using Gradle:

./gradlew clean build


4.5. Deploy to SCDF

Register the application using SCDF Shell:

dataflow:> app register --name view-processor --type processor --uri file:///path/to/jar

Create a stream:

dataflow:> stream create --name viewStream --definition "kafka-source | view-processor | gemfire-sink"

Deploy the stream:

dataflow:> stream deploy --name viewStream



---

5. Monitoring and Management

Use the SCDF Dashboard to monitor application logs and metrics.

View the status of deployed streams:

dataflow:> stream list

Check logs for any failures:

dataflow:> log view viewStream

Monitor Kafka Consumer Lag using Kafka UI or CLI to ensure timely data consumption.



---

6. Conclusion

Using SCDF for Oracle-to-GemFire cache data transfer ensures low latency, high-speed data processing, and efficient resource management.

With its scalable architecture, SCDF dynamically adjusts to data volume fluctuations, maintaining consistent application performance.

The centralized management and monitoring simplify the operations and troubleshooting process.


This approach is ideal for enterprises dealing with real-time data processing, financial transactions, or mission-critical applications requiring reliable data storage in GemFire Cache.
