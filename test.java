Title: Refactor GemFire Configuration to Use Annotations and Application Properties


---

Description:

The current GemFire configuration is implemented using functions and hardcoded properties. The client has requested changes to make the configuration more flexible and environment-driven. Specifically, the following changes are required:


---

Requirements:

1. Switch to Annotation-Based Configuration

Replace the function-based GemFire configuration with annotations provided by Spring Data for Apache Geode.

Simplify the configuration to rely on annotations and avoid manual function-based setups.



2. Use application.properties for Configuration

Move all GemFire-related properties (e.g., locators, regions, and other settings) to application.properties or application.yml.

Ensure configurations can be overridden in different environments.



3. Credentials and URL-Based Setup

Use GemFire credentials and URLs (provided by the client) for connecting to the cluster instead of relying on pre-existing GemFire JAR dependencies.

Update the code to use these credentials dynamically.



4. Retrieve Data as POJO Without PDX Configuration

Modify the current implementation to avoid configuring pdxInstance serialization. Ensure data retrieval works directly as Java objects (POJO) without the need for additional serialization setup.





---

Acceptance Criteria:

[ ] GemFire configuration is annotation-based and does not rely on functions.

[ ] All properties are moved to and managed via application.properties or application.yml.

[ ] Configuration works seamlessly across multiple environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod).

[ ] Authentication is handled using provided credentials and URLs.

[ ] Data can be retrieved as Java objects without PDX serialization configuration.



---

Additional Notes:

Ensure backward compatibility is maintained during the migration to the new configuration.

Provide unit tests and integration tests for the updated configuration.

Update documentation to reflect the new configuration approach.
